# Campaign

## Start SMS flow

`POST /v1/campaign/start_sms_flow` - Invokes a new SMS flow for a user with the desired campaign. To the user, it will be as if he had sent a text message himself to begin the flow.

The Campaign participation API allows a consumer to interact with specific campaigns that you've created in Mozes Connect.
For example: A consumer submits their mobile phone number on a web form. They can receive the text message flow that they would have received if they texted into the campaign keyword.
