Authentication
================

Headers
----------------
API requests must include two headers, `X-API-Key` and `X-API-Shared-Secret`, which can be requested by contacting support@mozes.com or speaking to your client services representative. Because the API key and shared secret are sent in plain text, requests must be made over SSL.

Request Generation
----------------
Requests are sent using HTTP POST. The "Content-Type" header of the request must be "application/json." In addition, the request must include the "X-API-Key" and "X-API-Shared-Secret" headers. The request data itself is sent as JSON formatted POST data. An example of a HTTP request is as follows:

```
User-Agent: curl/7.12.1 (i686-redhat-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.12.1 OpenSSL/0.9.7a zlib/1.2.1.2 libidn/0.5.6
Host: api.mozes.com
Pragma: no-cache
Accept: */*
Content-Type: application/json
X-API-Key: xxxxxx
X-API-Shared-Secret: XXXXXXXXXXX
Content-Length: 61

{"mozes_id":"nnnnnnnnn","project_id":nnnnn,"dob":"19750312"}
```

Response Format
----------------
JSON responses from the API follow a standard structure:
```json
{
    "status": {
        "code": 0,
        "name": "SHORT_NAME",
        "description": "Human readable description."
    },
    "response": {
        "arbitrary": "data",
        "integer": 184732,
        "string": "value"
    }
}
```
The "status" block contains a numeric return code, an alphanumeric code name, and longer description. The "response" block contains arbitrary data returned by the Web service called.
